# Time-series-forecasting-Project
Built and trained a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the stock prices of a company using historical data.
Imported and cleaned the dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
Preprocessed the data by converting the date column to numerical format and scaling the data between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler.
Split the data into training and test sets, and reshaped the data into the appropriate format for the LSTM model.
Used Keras to create and train the LSTM model, using mean squared error as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer.
Made predictions on the test set and visualized the results using matplotlib.
Demonstrated the ability to use LSTM model to predict stock prices, import and clean datasets, preprocess the data and evaluate the performance of the model using Python and relevant libraries.
